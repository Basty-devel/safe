**Safe - Enterprise Encryption Suite**

Safe is a professional-grade encryption application that implements military-grade cryptography with enforced security best practices. It combines modern cryptographic standards with an intuitive graphical interface to provide enterprise-level data protection.

Key Security Features
Military-Grade Cryptography
RSA-3072: 128-bit security for key encapsulation

ECC secp521r1: 256-bit security for key exchange

AES-256-GCM: Authenticated encryption for data protection

Enforced Security Policies
Strong Passphrases: 15+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols required

Key Rotation: Automatic 90-day rotation with visual expiration warnings

Identity Verification: Mandatory fingerprint verification before encryption

Secure Key Management
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: 600,000 iterations for key derivation

Encrypted Key Storage: Proprietary .ekey format for private keys

Storage Recommendations: Guidance for encrypted drive usage

Performance Optimizations
Large File Support: Chunked processing (64KB chunks)

Memory Efficiency: Minimal resource consumption

Progress Tracking: Visual indicators for long operations

Commercial Use Requirements:

Security audit for deployment in regulated environments

Compliance validation for financial or healthcare applications

Enterprise support subscription for production systems

Compliance
Safe implements cryptographic algorithms that comply with:

NIST FIPS 186-5 (Digital Signature Standard)

NIST SP 800-56A (Key Establishment)

NIST SP 800-131A (Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms)

RFC 7748 (Elliptic Curves for Security)

Security Disclaimer:
While Safe implements industry-standard cryptography, proper operational security practices are essential for maximum protection. Always:

Store private keys on encrypted drives

Verify recipient identities through secure channels

Rotate encryption keys every 90 days

Use 15+ character passphrases with mixed characters

Conduct regular security audits for critical deployments

For high-security environments, we recommend supplementing Safe with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and multi-factor authentication systems.
