Key Management Workflow
Navigate to "Key Management" tab

Enter strong passphrase (15+ chars with mixed characters)

Configure key rotation schedule

Generate ECC and RSA key pairs

Save keys to encrypted drive

Encryption Workflow
Select "Encryption" tab

Choose input (text or file)

Load recipient's public keys

Verify identity through key fingerprints

Encrypt and save output (.enc file)

Decryption Workflow
Select "Decryption" tab

Load encrypted file (.enc)

Load your private keys (.ekey)

Enter passphrase

Decrypt and save output

Security Best Practices
Key Management
üîí Strong Passphrases: 15+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols

‚öôÔ∏è Key Rotation: Automatic 90-day rotation with visual expiration warnings

üíæ Encrypted Storage: Private keys stored on encrypted drives only

üîÑ Key Separation: Different keys for different purposes

Operational Security
‚úÖ Identity Verification: Mandatory fingerprint verification before encryption

üîê Secure Channels: Use Signal, PGP-encrypted email, or secure messengers for key exchange

üïµÔ∏è Audit Trail: Key generation and expiration tracking

üßπ Memory Hygiene: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

Commercial Use Requirements:

Security audit for deployment in regulated environments

Compliance validation for financial or healthcare applications

Enterprise support subscription for production systems

Compliance
Safe implements cryptographic algorithms that comply with:

NIST FIPS 186-5 (Digital Signature Standard)

NIST SP 800-56A (Key Establishment)

NIST SP 800-131A (Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms)

RFC 7748 (Elliptic Curves for Security)

RFC 7518 (JSON Web Algorithms)

Security Disclaimer: While Safe implements industry-standard cryptography, proper operational security practices are essential for maximum protection. Always:

Store private keys on encrypted drives

Verify recipient identities through secure channels

Rotate encryption keys every 90 days

Use 15+ character passphrases with mixed characters

Conduct regular security audits for critical deployments

For high-security environments, we recommend supplementing SecureCrypt with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and multi-factor authentication systems.
